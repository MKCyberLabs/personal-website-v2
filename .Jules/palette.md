## 2026-04-16 - Accessibility of Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like a theme toggle) often lack accessible names by default, rendering them invisible or confusing to screen readers.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` (and often a `title`) to icon-only buttons to ensure they have an accessible name, especially in common components like headers.
